# visual ODD

The visual ODD (vODD) is a standardised graphical representation for agent-based models. 
Here, we provide templates for constructing a vODD. A full description of the vODD and guidance on how to build a vODD using the template are provided by Szangolies & Rohwäder et al. in "Visual ODD: a standardised visualisation illustrating the narrative of agent-based models" (submitted to *JASSS*). 

## Templates

We provide the templates as vector graphics (.svg) as well as PowerPoint slides (.pptx). You can choose between a basic version of the vODD, containing all mandatory elements, and a full version, which additionally contains the suggested optional elements:

* Basic template - vector file: Template_Basic.svg

* Basic template - Power Point file: Template_basic.pptx

* Template with optional elements - vector file: Template_Optional.svg

* Template with optional elements - Power Point file: Template_complete.pptx

## Structure

The vODD is a pictorial description of the key elements of the written model documentation following the Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol developed by Grimm et al. (2006, 2010, 2020).
The baseline vODD consists of three main sections, "Initialisation", "Submodels", and "Observations", represented by connected panels with a predefined position in the figure. 

### Initialisation
The “Initialisation” panel depicts how a simulation is initialised, including details about entities, their most important state variables, and, if applicable, spatial extents and resolution. 

### Submodels
The “Submodels” panel shows the processes and their order of execution, including the temporal resolution (and extent). 

### Observations
The “Observations” panel presents the information collected from the model.

### Optional elements
The vODD can be expanded to include optional elements, such as a "Purpose" line, empirical "Patterns" used, or details on "Scenarios" or simulation experiments. Panels for those elements are included in the templates with optional elements.
