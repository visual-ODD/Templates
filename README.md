# visual ODD

The visual ODD (vODD) is a standardised graphical representation for agent-based models. 
Here, we provide templates for constructing a vODD. A full description of the vODD and guidance on how to build a vODD using the template are provided by Szangolies & Rohw√§der et al. in "Visual ODD: a standardised visualisation illustrating the narrative of agent-based models" (submitted to *JASSS*). 

## Templates

We provide the templates as vector graphics (.svg) as well as PowerPoint slides (.pptx). You can choose between a basic version of the vODD, containing all mandatory elements, and a full version, which additionally contains the suggested optional elements:

* Basic template - vector file: Template_Basic.svg

* Basic template - Power Point file: Template_basic.pptx

* Template with optional elements - vector file: Template_Optional.svg

* Template with optional elements - Power Point file: Template_complete.pptx
